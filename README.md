### <a name='subtask1'>🔍 About the project</a>

A project I am about to present is the result of applying the knowledge gained from the module on *API testing with the Postman tool*, part of the **REST API Manual and Automation Foundation Level** course organized by [Jaktestowac.pl](https://jaktestowac.pl/). 

🧠**What have I revised and learnt in the process?**

✔️HTTP protocole and response codes
✔️REST API methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
✔️Work with API documentation on Swagger
✔️Test REST API with Chrome DevTools
✔️Create collections and different levels of variables
✔️Perform CRUD tests for various functionalities available in the app
✔️Test user Authentication and Authorization: Basic Auth, JWT and Bearer Auth
✔️Use Console in Postman to verify responses
✔️Write all the necessary pre-scripst and simple tests
✔️**Perform my first e2e test of deployed app**
